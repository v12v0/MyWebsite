              I recently graduated The University of Texas at Austin (Hook em!ü§òüèº) with a B.S in chemistry. Prior to enrolling in Flatiron school, I was working in California as a Forumalation Chemist.
              Upon realzing that I wasn't able to to translate my skills and knowledge into results i've decided to take a career path change and move back to Austin. Recently, i've been tinkering in HTML, CSS, and Javascipt
              in hopes of bringing my ideas and future projects to life! I can't wait to expand what i've learned and write my next chapter!
