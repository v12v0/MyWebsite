      <h1>My Background!</h1>
      <p> I recently graduated The University of Texas at austin (Hook em!🤘🏼) with a B.S in chemistry. Prior to enrolling in Flatiron school, I was working in California as a Forumalation Chemist.
        Upon realzing that I wasn't able to to translate my skills and knowledge into results i've decided to take a career path change. Recently, i've been tinkering in HTML, CSS, and Javascipt
        in hopes of bringing my ideas and future projects to life! I can't wait to expand what i've learned and write my next chapter! To learn more about me and my hobbies, click the "About me"
